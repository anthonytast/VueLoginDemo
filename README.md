# Full Stack Login Project

## Description
This is a sample full stack application I built in Vue.js. This starter project is designed to understand the core concepts of full stack within a node.js application.

It encorporates a multitude of Vue's key features, while using a FastAPI with user endpoints for login. HTTP Get, Post, Patch, and Delete methods are utelized by the variety of basic user functions.

## FastAPI Python Directory
Run the following commands at the FastAPI Directory

```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload 
```
*NOTE: The `--reload` flag will cause the application to reload every time the save is made within the directory*
This will run on localhost port 80 (unless otherwise specified)

## Vue.js Directory

Run the following commands at the Vue Directory

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```
This will run on localhost port 5173 (unless otherwise specified)
